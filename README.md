[WebUSB] based Interface Device (IFD) handler for USB based Chip Card Interface Device(s) ([CCID]).

This is a proof-of-concept developed for my diploma thesis. I was supported by Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Bundesdruckerei GmbH ("Federal Printing Office"), especially by my two advisors. They can not be held responsible for my work.

### Run Demo ###
To run the demo, host it with a (simple) web server. I suggest Python3 `python3 -m http.server 8000` (On Windows, just python, without 3).

### Developer Notes ###
Developed using Atom.io Editor using the packages atom-ctags, docblockr, and symbols-tree-view.

"function" declaration is used to have them shown in symbols-tree-view.
